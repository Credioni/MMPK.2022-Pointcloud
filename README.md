# MMPK.2022-Pointcloud
Approximating leaf area in pointclouded tree throught simulation. 

Final assignment of the course; Mathematical Modeling's Basic Course. 
Assigment was to evaluate tree's leaf area in a pointcloud data from HELIOS++ project. We extracted data from pointcloud which was done by single laser scanner. Scanner can only measure points which are on sight. Therefore, some leafs are not seen in a pointcloud. To approach the problem we constructed simple mathematical simulation of the enviroment and we obtained good result.
